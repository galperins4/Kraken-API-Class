# Kraken-API-Class
# This is a work in progress 
# working - base API calls (public and private)
# not implemented - error handling, otp usage, anything else I haven't thought of

# Please be gentle..... started learning Python in June :)

# Note: Thanks to veox [KRAKEN PYTHON API][kraken] for his example that was leveraged as I was working on this!
